# DKGNonRepudiation
## Interoperable Non-Repudiation Protocol powered by DKGs


This is the main repo of the project carried out during my research period at the University of Strathclyde under supervision of Prof. Ross Horne.

During these three weeks we worked on a novel approach to non-repudiation, which led us to consider it as a novel proposal for HTTP Signature protocol.

The repository is structured into four folders, one per each agent of the system.
### Demo App
It is a demo of an app interacting with a Solid Community Solid Server.
### Demo Issuer
It is a demo of an issuer responsible for releasing credentials to the users.
### Demo TTP
It is a demo for a Trusted Third Party, responsible for decrypting the message of the protocol
### Demo User
It is a demo for the wallet of the user, which receives credentials, create new VP and send it to the App.
